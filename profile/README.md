# ðŸ¥³ Welcome to Our GitHub Organization
Founded on March 23rd, 2010, The Xeriscape Network has existed as a community of friends brought together by their love of gaming; We welcome members from all walks of life and currently consist of an international membership.

The community was founded with the intention of being a fun, welcoming, and friendly environment that anyone can join. We also believe in helping and challenging each other to push the limits of what we think we're capable of to help inspire growth and have fun while doing it.

The primary goal for our community is to be a positive and respectful space where members can engage in discussion and play with each other without any cheating, inappropriate content, toxic behavior, and other negative topics.

For additional information about our community, such as history and background, we encourage you to check out [our website](https://xeriscape.network/).
